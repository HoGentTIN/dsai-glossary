# alternative hypothesis

(NL: [alternatieve hypothese](../nl/alternatieve-hypothese.md))

In the context of a [statistical hypothesis test](hypothesis-test.md), the **alternative hypothesis** (often written as $H_1$) is an assumption about a population parameter that we want to test.

The alternative hypothesis usually represents the assumption that there is a significant difference between the population parameter and a given value, or that there is a relationship between two variables.

The procedure of the test is based on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. If we then encounter a contradiction, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted.
