# association

(NL: [verband](../nl/verband.md))

In the context of [bivariate analysis](analysis-bivariate.md), we speak of an **association** (or relation) between two variables if the values of one variable systematically change as the values of the other variable change. In other words, if you know the value of one variable, you can - to a certain extent - predict the value of the other variable.

Usually we assume that one variable exerts a certain influence on the other. The variable that we suspect exerts the influence is called the **independent variable**. The variable that we suspect is influenced is called the **dependent variable**.

Researchers must be careful that, if an association is found between two variables, this does not necessarily imply a causal relationship. The "influence" can go in the opposite direction, or both variables can be influenced by a third, unexamined, variable. Demonstrating a causal relationship requires a specific research design, in which the researcher excludes the influence of all other variables.
