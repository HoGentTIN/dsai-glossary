# central limit theorem

(NL: [centrale limietstelling](../nl/centrale-limietstelling.md))

The **central limit theorem** says that the probability distribution of the sample mean will resemble the [normal distribution](normal-distribution.md) as the [sample size](sample-size.md) increases.

Or, more specifically, if you take a sufficiently large ($n >30$) random sample from a population with expected value $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, then the [sample mean](mean.md#sample-mean) $\bar{x}$ will have a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. This holds regardless of the distribution of the population!

The central limit theorem is an important basis for many statistical methods, such as [confidence intervals](confidence-interval.md) and [hypothesis tests](hypothesis-test.md). It dictates the conditions under which we can generalize a result from a sample (to a certain extent) to the population.
