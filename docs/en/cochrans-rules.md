# Cochran's rules

(NL: [Cochran's regels](../nl/cochrans-regels.md))

Cochran's rules are a set of rules to determine whether the results of a chi-square test are reliable. More specifically, there should be "sufficient" observations in each category of a contingency table or frequency table to apply the chi-square test. Cochran's rules determine how much "sufficient" exactly is.

The rules are typically formulated as follows:

1. Each cell in the table should have an **expected frequency** of **at least 1**.
2. In **at least 80%** of the cells, the **expected frequency should be at least 5** (or at most 20% of the cells may have an expected frequency of less than 5).

The rules are named after the American statistician [William G. Cochran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gemmell_Cochran) to whom they are attributed, based on his work in the 1950s (Cochran, 1952; 1954, p.420). For an extensive discussion of Cochran's rules, see Kroonenberg & Verbeek (2018).
