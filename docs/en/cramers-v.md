# Cramer's V

(NL: [Cramer's V](../nl/cramers-v.md))

**Cram√©r's V** is a measure of association between two qualitative variables. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means no association and 1 means perfect association. It is based on the chi-square statistic and is defined as

$$V = \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n(k-1)}}$$

where $\chi^2$ is the [chi-squared statistic](chi-squared.md), $n$ is the number of observations, and $k$ is the number of categories in the contingency table.
