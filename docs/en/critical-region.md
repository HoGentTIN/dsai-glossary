# critical region

(NL: [kritieke gebied](../nl/kritieke-gebied.md))

In the context of [hypothesis tests](hypothesis-test.md), the **critical region** (also: rejection region) is the set of all possible values for the [test statistic](test-statistic.md) for which we will reject the [null hypothesis](null-hypothesis.md).

Or, in other words, this is the set of all values for the test statistic for which the [p-value](p-value.md) is less than the [significance level](significance-level.md).

The values for which we do not reject the null hypothesis from the [region of acceptance](region-of-acceptance.md).
