# critical value

(NL: [kritieke grenswaarde](../nl/kritieke-grenswaarde.md))

In the context of [hypothesis tests](hypothesis-test.md), the **critical value** is the value that lies on the boundary between the [critical region](critical-region.md) and the [region of acceptance](region-of-acceptance.md).

More specifically, this is a value for which the [p-value](p-value.md) $p$ is equal to the [significance level](significance-level.md) $\alpha$.
