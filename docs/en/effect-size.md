# effect size

(NL: [effectgrootte](../nl/effectgrootte.md))

The *effect size* is a measure that expresses the strength of an [association](association.md) between two variables.

Depending on the context, and more specifically on the measurement levels of the variables, there are different methods to define an effect size.

- [Cramer's V](cramers-v.md) is a measure for the strength of the association between two [qualitative variables](level-of-measurement.md#qualitative-variables).

- [Cohen's d](cohens-d.md) is a measure for the difference (of the mean) between two groups.

- Pearson's [correlation coefficient](correlation.md#correlation-coefficient) is a measure for the strength of a linear association between two [quantitative variables](level-of-measurement.md#quantitative-variables).

In addition to these, there are dozens of definitions of effect sizes, each with their own scope and interpretation.

Effect sizes are complementary to [hypothesis testing](hypothesis-test.md). A hypothesis test determines whether an association is statistically significant, while an effect size indicates how strong that association is.
