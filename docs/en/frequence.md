# frequence

(NL: [frequentie](../nl/frequentie.md))

The *frequency* of a value of a variable in a data set or sample is the number of times that value occurs.

We distinguish on the one hand the *absolute frequency* (= the actual number) and on the other hand the *relative frequency* (= what percentage of the total number of observations takes this value, as a fraction between 0 and 1).

The frequencies of each unique value occurring in the sample are summarized in a *frequency table*. A frequency table that summarizes the frequencies of the combination of the values of two variables is also called a (TODO) contingency table, crosstab (NL: (TODO) kruistabel).
