# interquartile range

(NL: [interkwartielafstand (IQR)](../nl/interkwartielafstand.md))

The interquartile range (IQR) of a sample or population is calculated as:

\[ IQR = | Q_3 - Q_1 | \]

With $Q_3$ the third [quartile](percentile.md#quartile) and $Q_1$ the first quartile.

Between $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ you will find 50% of the observations in the sample.

The interquartile range is a [measure of dispersion](measure-of-dispersion.md) for [quantitative](level-of-measurement.md#quantitative-variables) variables. It is less sensitive to outliers than the [standard deviation](variance.md#standard-deviation-of-a-sample) and is therefore better suited than the standard deviation for variables that are not [normally distributed](normal-distribution.md).
