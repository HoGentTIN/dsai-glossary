# mean

(NL: [gemiddelde](../nl/gemiddelde.md))

The mean is a [measure of central tendency](measure-of-central-tendency.md) that is especially suited for [quantitative](level-of-measurement.md#quantitative-variables) variables.

The mean is often used in comnbination with the [standard deviation](variance.md#standard-deviation) to describe the characteristics of a [sample](sample.md).

## sample mean

The (arithmetic) mean $\overline{x}$ of a sample $X = \{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$ of size $n$ is

\[\overline{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{x=1}^{n} x_i\]

## population mean

The mean of a population is notated with the [Greek letter](greek-alphabet.md) mu: $\mu$. The calculation is equivalent with the sample mean.
