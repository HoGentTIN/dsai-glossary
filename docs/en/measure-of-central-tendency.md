# measure of central tendency, mean

(NL: [centrummaat](../nl/centrummaat.md))

A *measure of central tendency* (or *mean*) for a variable is a value that is considered "typical" for that group. There are several ways to calculate a measure of central tendency. Only a few are listed below.

Depending on the level of measurement, specific measures are ideally suited:

- [Qualitative](level-of-measurement.md#qualitative-variables) variables: [mode](mode.md)
- [Quantitative](level-of-measurement.md#quantitative-variables) variables: [arithmetic mean](mean.md), [median](median.md)

In addition to a measure of center, one typically also uses a [measure of dispersion](measure-of-dispersion.md) to express the variability of observations for that variable.
