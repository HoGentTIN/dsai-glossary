# measure of dispersion

(NL: [spreidingsmaat](../nl/spreidingsmaat.md))

A *measure of dispersion* expresses the extent to which values in a sample or population differ from each other.

There are several ways to determine a measure of dispersion, we will use only a few of them in this course. The measures of dispersion discussed are only suitable for [quantitative](level-of-measurement.md#quantitative-variables) variables.

- [variance](variance.md) and [standard deviation](variance.md#standard-deviation)
- [interquartile range](interquartile-range.md) and [range](range.md)

Together with a [measure of central tendency](measure-of-central-tendency.md), a measure of dispersion forms a way of expressing the characteristics of observations for a variable.
