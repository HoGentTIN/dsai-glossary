# median

(NL: [mediaan](../nl/mediaan.md))

The *median* of a sample or population is the value that separates the lower half of the values from the higher half.

You can determine the median by sorting the values and taking the middle value (if the number is odd), or the average of the two middle values (if the number is even).

The median can be used with [quantitative](level-of-measurement.md#quantitative-variables) variables or [ordinal](level-of-measurement.md#ordinal-scale).

The [measure of dispersion](measure-of-dispersion.md) that is often used together with this measure of center is the [interquartile range](interquartile-range.md).
