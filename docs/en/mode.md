# mode

(NL: [modus](../nl/modus.md))

The *mode* of a ([qualitative](level-of-measurement.md#qualitative-variables)) variable is the value that occurs most frequently in the [sample](sample.md).

In principle you can also calculate the mode of a [quantitative](level-of-measurement.md#quantitative-variables) variable, but that is usually not useful.
