# p-value

(NL: [overschrijdingskans](../nl/overschrijdingskans.md))

The **p-value** is the probability that the value of the [test statistic](test-statistic.md) (or one that is at least as extreme) can be obtained if the null hypothesis is true.

When the p-value is less than the [significance level](significance-level.md) that was chosen in advance, or $p \leq \alpha$, then the null hypothesis is rejected and the [alternative hypothesis](alternative-hypothesis.md) is accepted. If $p > \alpha$ then the null hypothesis is not rejected.
