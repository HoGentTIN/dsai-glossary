# percentile

(NL: [percentiel](../nl/percentiel.md))

A percentile of an ordered series of observations is one of basically 99 points that divides the series into 100 equally sized parts. The $k$th percentile, then, is a number where $k$% of the observations are smaller and $(100-k)$% are greater than that number.

## quartile

The quartiles are formed from five specific percentiles that divide the series into 4 equally sized parts:

- $\min$, the minimum, or percentile 0
- $Q_1$, the first quartile or percentile 25
- $Q_2$, the median, or percentile 50
- $Q_3$, the third quartile or percentile 75
- $\max$, the maximum, or percentile 100

The difference between the largest and smallest value is called [range](range.md), and between the third and first quartiles is called [interquartile range](interquartile-range.md).
