# point estimate

(NL: [puntschatter](../nl/puntschatter.md))

A **point estimate** is a value calculated from a sample that tries to approximate an unknown population parameter as well as possible.

The formula for the [sample standard deviation](variance.md#standard-deviation-of-a-sample) $s$ is a point estimate for the (unknown) [population standard deviation](variance.md#standard-deviation-of-a-population) $\sigma$.

An estimator is sometimes denoted as $\hat{\theta}$, where $\theta$ is an unknown population parameter.
