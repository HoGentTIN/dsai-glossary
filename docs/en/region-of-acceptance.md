# region of acceptance

(NL: [aanvaardingsgebied](../nl/aanvaardingsgebied.md))

In the context of [hypothesis tests](hypothesis-test.md), the **region of acceptance** is the set of all possible values for the [test statistic](test-statistic.md) for which we will accept the [null hypothesis](null-hypothesis.md).

Or, in other words, this is the set of all values for the test statistic for which the [p-value](p-value.md) $p$ is greater than the [significance level](significance-level.md) $\alpha$.

The values for which we reject the null hypothesis, form the [critical region](critical-region.md). The border between both areas is called the [critical value](critical-value.md).
