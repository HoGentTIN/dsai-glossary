# sample, representative

(NL: [steekproef, representatieve](../nl/steekproef-representatieve.md))

A sample is *representative* if the properties of the [population](population.md) are also reflected within the [sample](sample.md).

For example, if in a population 53% identify themselves as female, 46% as male, and 1% as nonbinary, then as a researcher you want these proportions to be reflected in a sample as well.

Small deviations are acceptable, though, and a researcher can verify whether this is the case using a [chi-squared goodness-of-fit test](chi-squared-goodness-of-fit-test.md).
