# sample

(NL: [steekproef](../nl/steekproef.md))

A **sample** is a subset from a population on which the research is conducted.

Under [certain circumstances](central-limit-theorem.md), you may assume that results obtained in the sample also apply to the population as a whole.

A "good" sample has several properties:

- the sample is [random](sample-random.md)
- the sample is sufficiently large
- the sample is [representative](sample-representative.md) for the population

Ideally, a researcher would do the following to draw a sample from a population:

- first and foremost, the population must be well defined
- then you can compile a [sampling frame](sampling-frame.md), i.e. a list of all individuals in a population
- then the researcher [randomly](sample-random.md) selects a number of individuals

It is often difficult or impossible to set up a sampling frame. In such cases, the researcher chooses a different sampling method and tries to approximate the properties listed above as closely as possible within the available time and budget.

Even under the best of circumstances, the result within a sample is likely to deviate from the "true" value in the [population](population.md), although we hope we can approach it sufficiently. So by taking a sample we introduce [errors](sampling-errors.md).
