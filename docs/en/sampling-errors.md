# sampling errors

(NL: [steekproeffouten](../nl/steekproeffouten.md))

When researchers investigate a [population](population.md) based on a [sample](sample.md), it is inevitable that errors are made, i.e. results of measurements and analyses within the sample will not correspond to the true value over the entire population.

The way we take a sample can influence the results.

## sampling error

We discern between *random* or *systematic* sampling errors:

### random sampling error

*Random* sampling errors are only due to chance and cannot be avoided. Every time you take a random sample, you will get a different result within that sample.

### systematic sampling error

A *systematic* sampling error is worse, because it can cause the results to be biased and therefore no longer be [representative](sample-representative.md) for the population. Examples of systematic sampling errors:

- In an online survey, only people with internet access are selected. So this sample is no longer [random](sample-random.md).
- If you conduct a survey in which people participate voluntarily, you have a greater chance that people who are also interested in the subject participate. This can also have an impact on the results.

## non-sampling error

After taking the sample, errors can also be made in the measurement and analysis. In this case we speak of non-sampling errors and again we distinguish between *random* and *systematic*:

### random non-sampling error

For example, a respondent accidentally selects or fills out a wrong answer in a survey.

### systematic non-sampling error

Examples:

- a measuring device is not calibrated correctly and systematically gives a slightly higher value than ther actual one
- respondents intentionally underestimate or overestimate reality (e.g. when asked about how much you smoke or drink alcohol on a daily basis)
