# significance level

(NL: [significantieniveau](../nl/significantieniveau.md))

In the context of [statistical hypothesis tests](hypothesis-test.md), the **significance level** ($\alpha$) is the probability that the [null hypothesis](null-hypothesis.md) is rejected when it is actually true.

The significance level is related to the confidence level ($1 - \alpha$) of a confidence interval.
