# t-distribution

Also: Student's t-distribution

(NL: [t-verdeling](../nl/t-verdeling.md))

The **t-distribution** (also: Student's t-distribution) is a continuous [probability distribution](probability-distribution.md) that is used instead of the [normal distribution](normal-distribution.md) when the [standard deviation](variance.md#standard-deviation-of-a-population) of a population is not known or when the sample size is not large enough.

The [probability density function](probability-distribution.md#probability-density-function) looks like that of the normal distribution, but is "flatter" and has wider "tails". The t-distribution also takes the [sample size](sample-size.md) $n$ into account, via an extra parameter, the **degrees of freedom** or $n-1$.

The *cumulative* probability density function looks like this:

The $t$ distribution was developed by the English statistician, chemist and brewer [William Sealy Gosset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset), who published under the pseudonym "Student". The distribution was first described in 1908 in [an article](http://seismo.berkeley.edu/~kirchner/eps_120/Odds_n_ends/Students_original_paper.pdf) in the journal Biometrika.
