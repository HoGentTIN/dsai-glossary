# z-score

Also: standard score

(NL: [z-score](../nl/z-score.md))

The **z-score** is a number that indicates how many standard deviations a certain value deviates from the mean.

The z-score of an observation $x$ from a stochastic variable $X$ with expectation $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ is given by:

$$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$
